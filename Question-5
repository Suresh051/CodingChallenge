7) Can you write a Ansible playbook to delete all the files in /tmp directory which are older than 3 days. and list the results number of files cleaned and size saved, and the list of files couldn't delete due to lock.
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: find all files that are older than 3 days
      find:
        paths: /tmp
        age: 3d
        recurse: yes
      register: filesOlderThan3
    - name: remove older than 3
      file:
        path: "{{ item.path }}" 
        state: absent
      with_items: "{{ filesOlderThan3.files }}"
      
      - debug:
      msg: "{{ filesOlderThan3.files }}"
      
      vars:
  lock_file_path=/tmp/*.lock

pre_tasks: 
   - stat: path={{lock_file_path}}
     register: lock_file

   - fail: msg="Sorry, I found a lockfile, so I'm assuming that someone was already running ansible when you started this deploy job. Add -f to your deploy command to forcefully continue deploying, if the previous deploy was aborted."
   when: lock_file.stat.exists|bool and not force_ignore_lock|bool
